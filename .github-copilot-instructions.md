# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Portfolio Roberto

## Project Overview
This is a professional portfolio website built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The portfolio showcases Roberto's skills, projects, and passion for photography.

## Key Design Principles
- **Dark Theme**: Use slate-900 to slate-800 gradient backgrounds
- **Gradient Accents**: Blue-purple-pink gradients for text and buttons (from-blue-400 via-purple-500 to-pink-500)
- **Modern UI**: Clean, minimalist design with smooth animations
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design prioritizing mobile experience

## Component Architecture
- Each section is a separate component in `src/components/`
- Components follow React functional component pattern with TypeScript
- Use Lucide React for consistent iconography
- Maintain consistent spacing with Tailwind utilities

## Styling Guidelines
- **Backgrounds**: `bg-slate-900`, `bg-slate-800/50`, `bg-slate-700/50`
- **Text Colors**: `text-white`, `text-gray-300`, `text-gray-400`
- **Gradients**: `bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-400 via-purple-500 to-pink-500`
- **Borders**: `border-slate-600/50`, `border-slate-700/50`
- **Hover Effects**: `hover:transform hover:scale-105`, `transition-all duration-300`
